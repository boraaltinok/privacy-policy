# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the **AI Baby Generator: BabyBlend** app (the “Application”) for mobile devices, created by **NEXTLINE YAZILIM LİMİTED ŞİRKETİ** (“Service Provider”) as a commercial service. This service is provided **“AS IS.”**

---

## Information Collection and Use
The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:

- Your device's Internet Protocol address (IP address)  
- The pages of the Application you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages  
- The time spent in the Application  
- The operating system of your mobile device  

The Application does **not** gather precise, GPS-level location data. It may collect **approximate location** (e.g., based on IP address) for:

- **Geolocation Services**: Personalized content, relevant recommendations, and location-based features  
- **Analytics and Improvements**: Aggregated, anonymized location data for analyzing user behavior, identifying trends, and improving performance  
- **Third-Party Services**: Periodically transmitting anonymized location data to external services for app improvement and optimization  

The Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact you with important notices, required information, and marketing promotions.

For a better experience, the Application may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to **device ID, user ID, and photos that may contain faces**. We do **not** collect biometric identifiers such as face geometry, fingerprints, or iris scans.

---

## Face Data & Biometric Information
**What we collect:**  
The Application allows you to upload photos of the mother, father, and optionally a child, which may contain human faces. We do **not** collect or create biometric identifiers, facial templates, or facial embeddings. We do **not** perform facial recognition, identity verification, or authentication.

**How we use it:**  
Face images are used **only** for:
1. Generating an AI “future baby” image by blending parental facial features, and  
2. Optionally calculating similarity percentages between a provided child photo and each parent.  

We do **not** use face data for advertising, tracking, profiling, or authentication.

**Sharing:**  
Face images are transmitted securely to the **Google Gemini API** for processing. We do not store uploaded images on our own servers, and we do not share them with advertisers, data brokers, or other unrelated third parties.

**Retention:**  
- **On our servers:** None — we do not persist uploaded face images.  
- **On your device:** Only if you choose to save the generated image to your Photos.  
- **At Gemini:** Under our billing-enabled (paid) Gemini API configuration, Google does **not** use inputs/outputs to train models. Gemini may retain request data for **up to 55 days** for service delivery and abuse monitoring, after which it is deleted. This retention is managed by Google.  

For more details, see **AI Image Processing via Gemini API** below.

## AI Image Processing via Gemini API
The Application uses the **Gemini API**, a third-party service provided by Google, to process and generate images for the purposes described above. Images are securely transmitted over TLS to Gemini’s servers for processing.  

We use a **billing-enabled (paid)** Gemini API account, which means:
- Google does **not** use your inputs or outputs to train its models.  
- Data is retained only for service delivery and abuse monitoring (up to 55 days), then deleted.  
- Retention and deletion are managed by Google, not by us.  

For details, see Gemini’s official terms: [https://ai.google.dev/terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms)

By using the Application, you consent to your images being processed under these conditions.
