## 1. Information Collection

When you use Internet Speed Tester ("the App"), operated by NEXTLINE YAZILIM LiMiTED SiRKETi ("Service Provider," "we," "our"), we may collect and process the following types of information:

### 1.1 Speed Test Data
- **Network Measurements**: When you run a speed test, the app measures your internet connection's download speed, upload speed, and latency (ping). These measurements are performed by connecting to external speed test servers and DNS providers (Cloudflare, Google DNS).
- **Connection Type**: The app detects whether you are connected via Wi-Fi, cellular, or ethernet.
- **What Speed Tests May Reveal**: Network measurements inherently expose your device's IP address and standard connection metadata to the speed test servers and DNS providers used for measurement purposes.
- **Local Storage**: Speed test results (including download/upload speeds, latency, connection type, timestamp, and quality rating) are stored locally on your device. The app retains your last 50 test results, automatically removing older entries.
- **No Cloud Storage**: Speed test results are not transmitted to or stored on our servers.

### 1.2 Device and Usage Information
- **Device Identifiers**: We collect anonymous device identifiers for analytics and crash reporting purposes.
- **App Usage Data**: Information about how you interact with the app, including features used, session duration, and navigation patterns.
- **Approximate Location**: We may collect approximate location data (e.g., based on IP address) for analytics and service improvement. We do not collect precise GPS-level location data.

### 1.3 Anonymous Identifiers
- **Locally-Generated Identifiers**: The app generates a local anonymous identifier (UUID) on your device for analytics and purchase management purposes. No authentication system or user accounts are used. This identifier does not require you to provide any personal information such as name, email, or phone number.

### 1.4 App Preferences
- **Language Preference**: Your selected display language is stored locally on your device.
- **Purchase Status**: Whether you have purchased ad removal is stored locally.
- **Usage Statistics**: Basic counters such as total tests completed are stored locally.

## 2. Third-Party Access

### 2.1 Firebase Crashlytics (Google)
We utilize Firebase Crashlytics, provided by Google, for monitoring app stability and fixing crashes.

Firebase may collect additional data as described in Google's Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

### 2.2 Google AdMob
- **Purpose**: Serving advertisements within the app
- **Data Collected**: Device identifiers, ad interaction data (impressions, clicks), and device information for ad targeting
- **Personalized Ads**: If you grant App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permission on iOS, personalized ads may be served based on your interests. If you deny permission, non-personalized ads will be served with no impact on core app functionality

- **Privacy Policy**: https://policies.google.com/privacy

### 2.5 Speed Test Infrastructure
- **Purpose**: Measuring your internet connection speed and latency
- **Services Used**: External speed test servers (via flutter_internet_speed_test), Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), and Google DNS (dns.google) for ping/latency measurement
- **Data Exposed**: Your IP address and standard network connection metadata are inherently exposed when connecting to these services for measurement purposes

### 2.6 Apple App Store / Google Play Store
- **Purpose**: App distribution and in-app purchase processing
- **Data Collected**: Purchase information is processed through the respective platform

The Service Provider may disclose user-provided or automatically collected information:
- As required by law (e.g., to comply with legal processes such as a subpoena)
- When necessary to protect rights, safety, or investigate fraud
- With trusted service providers working on our behalf, bound by confidentiality agreements consistent with this privacy policy

## 3. How We Use Information

### 3.4 Advertising
- **Ad Display**: Non-premium users are shown interstitial advertisements via Google AdMob
