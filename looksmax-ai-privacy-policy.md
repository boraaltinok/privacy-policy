## **2. Face Data and AI-Based Analysis**

### **2.1 Collection and Local Storage of Images**
- When you request a **face rating** or **analysis** within the Application, you may provide us with a selfie or photo containing your face.  
- We **do not** store these images on our own servers. Instead, the images are temporarily stored on your device for you to view and manage locally.

### **2.2 AI Processing by a Third-Party Service**
- The Application leverages a **third-party AI service** (“AI Provider”) to generate face ratings or other visual insights.  
- **User-Initiated**: Your face image is only sent to the AI Provider when you **actively request** a face rating or analysis.  
- **Transmission**: The photo is transmitted **securely** (HTTPS) to the AI Provider, which uses it **solely** to fulfill your requested analysis.  
- **Short-Term Retention**: The AI Provider may retain the image briefly (typically up to 30 days) to monitor for abuse and maintain system integrity, after which it is deleted.  
- **No Facial Recognition**: We do **not** perform or facilitate facial recognition to identify individuals; the analysis focuses on aesthetic or visual metrics only.

### **2.3 No Sale or Extended Use of Face Data**
- We do **not** sell, lease, or share your face images or derived face data with any third parties for their independent use.  
- We **only** transmit your images to the AI Provider to provide the feature you specifically requested.

### **2.4 Retention and Deletion of Face Data**
- **Local Deletion**: Images remain on your device unless you remove them.
- **AI Provider Deletion**: The AI Provider deletes your face images after a short retention period (up to 30 days), per its data policies. If you have specific concerns, please contact us at [support@nextline.software](mailto:support@nextline.software), and we will assist where possible.
