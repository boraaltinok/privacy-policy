This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, and we encourage you to review it periodically. Your continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of any modifications to this policy.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### 1.1 Automatically Collected Information
When you download and use the Application, certain data may be automatically collected, such as:
- **IP Address** (Internet Protocol address)
- **Device operating system and model**
- **Pages/screens visited within the Application**
- **Time spent on each page/screen and dates/times of visits**
- **App version and build number**
- **Session duration and app lifecycle events** (foreground/background transitions)

We may use this automatically collected information for analytics, troubleshooting, and to improve the functionality of the Application.

### 1.2 Location Data
The Application does **not** gather information about the location of your mobile device. No location permissions are requested or used.

### 1.3 User-Provided Information
For a better experience, we may require you to provide certain information, including (but not limited to):
- **User ID**: An anonymous identifier automatically generated by Firebase Authentication. No personal information (name, email, phone number) is required for account creation.
- **Device ID**: A unique device identifier used for analytics and service operation.
- **Target Language Preference**: Your selected translation language, stored locally on your device.

This information will be retained and used as described in this policy.

## 2. Image Processing and Cloud Storage

### 2.1 How Image Processing Works
The core functionality of the Application involves processing images containing text for translation. When you use the Application:
1. You capture an image using your device camera or select an image from your photo library.
2. The image is uploaded securely via HTTPS to our cloud servers (Firebase Storage).
3. The image is processed server-side using AI-powered text extraction (OCR) and translation services.
4. The translated text and translated image are returned to you within the Application.

### 2.2 Image Storage
- Uploaded images are stored in Firebase Storage under your anonymous user account at the path `users/{your_user_id}/uploads/`.
- Translated result images are stored at `users/{your_user_id}/results/`.
- Translation metadata (status, translated text, language pair) is stored in Firebase Cloud Firestore.
- Images and translation data are **not automatically deleted**. They persist unless you request deletion by contacting us at [support@nextline.software](mailto:support@nextline.software).

### 2.3 Important Notice About Image Content
Images you upload may contain sensitive information such as personal documents, addresses, or private communications. We recommend reviewing images before uploading and avoiding the capture of sensitive personal data that is not intended for translation.

### 2.4 Server-Side Processing
Image processing (text extraction and translation) is performed on our cloud servers. Images are transmitted securely via HTTPS. The AI processing is handled server-side, and no on-device AI or machine learning models are used.

## 3. Anonymous Authentication

The Application uses **Firebase Anonymous Authentication** to create a user account automatically upon first launch. This means:
- **No personal information** (name, email, password, phone number) is collected during account creation.
- A unique anonymous identifier (UID) is generated and used to isolate your data from other users.
- This UID is linked to your analytics profile and subscription status for service operation.

---

## 4. Analytics and Tracking

### 4.1 Analytics Services
The Application uses the following analytics services to understand usage patterns and improve the Application:

- **Google Analytics for Firebase**: Collects usage data, screen views, and app events. Data is processed by Google in accordance with their privacy policy.
- **Amplitude**: Collects session data, feature usage events, screen views, and custom events such as translation activity, paywall interactions, and error occurrences.

### 4.2 Events Tracked
The Application tracks the following types of events for analytics purposes:
- Translation activity (started, completed, failed)
- Camera and gallery usage
- Paywall views and subscription events
- Screen navigation
- Error occurrences (for debugging and improvement)

### 4.3 App Tracking Transparency (iOS)
On iOS devices, the Application requests your permission via Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework before collecting your device's advertising identifier (IDFA). This identifier may be used for personalized content delivery and advertising attribution. You may decline this request, and the Application will continue to function normally without access to your advertising identifier.

---

## 5. Local Data Storage

The Application stores certain data locally on your device using Hive (a local database):
- **Usage tracking**: Number of translations performed today and the date of the last translation.
- **User identity**: Your anonymous user ID and its source.
- **Language preferences**: Your selected target translation language.
- **App settings**: Whether you have completed the onboarding process.
- **Analytics configuration**: Amplitude user settings and A/B test variant assignments.

This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers unless described elsewhere in this policy.

## 12. Security

We take reasonable measures (physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards) to protect information under our control from unauthorized access or disclosure. Specifically:
- All data transmissions between the Application and our servers are encrypted via secure connections (HTTPS).
- Firebase Security Rules restrict access so that users can only read and write their own data.
- Uploaded images are limited to 10MB and must be image file types.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
