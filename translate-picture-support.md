## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How do I get started with Translate Picture?**
A: Simply download the app from the App Store, complete the brief onboarding process, and you're ready to start translating. Point your camera at any text, capture an image, select your target language, and receive your translation in seconds.

**Q: How does the translation work?**
A: When you capture or select an image, it is securely uploaded to our cloud servers where AI technology extracts the text and translates it into your chosen language. The translated text and a translated version of the image are then sent back to your device.

**Q: What languages are supported?**
A: The app supports a wide range of languages for translation. You can select your target language from the language picker within the app. The AI automatically detects the source language in your images.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes, we prioritize data security. All data transmission between your device and our servers is encrypted via HTTPS. Your images and translations are stored under your anonymous user account, and Firebase Security Rules ensure only you can access your data.

**Q: Who owns the content I create in the app?**

### Translation Questions

**Q: How accurate are the translations?**
A: Our AI-powered translations are designed to be as accurate as possible, but like all machine translation, they may not be perfect. We recommend verifying translations for critical use cases such as legal, medical, or financial documents.

**Q: Why did my translation fail?**
A: Translations can fail for several reasons:
- Poor image quality or blurry text
- Very small or hard-to-read text in the image
- Unusual fonts or handwritten text
- Network connectivity issues during upload or processing
Try retaking the image with better lighting and focus, or ensure you have a stable internet connection.

**Q: How long does a translation take?**
A: Most translations complete within a few seconds. The time depends on image complexity, text volume, and current server load. You can track the progress in real-time within the app.
