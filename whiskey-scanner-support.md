## Scanning Guide

### Best Practices for Scanning
- **Good lighting**: Ensure the bottle label is well-lit, avoid harsh glare
- **Center the label**: Align the bottle label within the frame guide
- **Hold steady**: Keep your phone stable when capturing
- **Front label**: Scan the front label for best results
- **Avoid barcodes**: Point at the label, not the barcode

### What You Get from a Scan
- Bottle name and brand identification
- Category and country of origin
- AI Professor's first impression (witty expert commentary)
- Flavor profile hex chart (9 dimensions)
- ABV, type, age, cask information
- MSRP and pricing estimates
- Option to add to your collection

### Scan Not Working?
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection (scanning requires internet)
- Make sure camera permissions are enabled in your device settings
- Try better lighting or a different angle on the label
- If the label is damaged or obscured, try the manual search feature

## AI Whiskey Professor

### How It Works
The Professor is an AI-powered whiskey advisor that knows about your collection. You can:
- Ask general whiskey questions
- Get recommendations based on what you own
- Compare bottles in your collection
- Learn about different whiskey styles, regions, and production methods

### Chat Tips
- Be specific: "Compare my Lagavulin 16 and Ardbeg 10" works better than "compare two bottles"
- Use suggested prompts for quick conversations
- Chat history is saved locally for session persistence

### Bartender Mode
When viewing a bottle's details, tap "Chat About This Bottle" to enter Bartender Mode. The Professor will focus the conversation on that specific bottle — ideal for deep dives on a particular whiskey.
